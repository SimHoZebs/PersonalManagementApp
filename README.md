## Motivation

There are _soo_ many tools out there for management, especially for projects and companies. You probably already use one. I've tried so many as a _personal_ management app, only for Notion to be the last man standing.

But Notion isn't a management app. It's a great blank canvas with great components that can _build_ a management system. But to build one, you must research and understand what they need in such a system, how they should build one, and so on. It's a lot of work.

This project's goal is to get rid of that work and effort, built with a single goal in mind: **Do less, get more done** - on a personal level.

## What this app is NOT

### 1. An all-in-one tool

"Context switching is bad.", they say. Yet, all-in-one tools take you out of context by constraining you to a single screen for all your needs.

This project may work as an alternative for some apps, like Google Calendar, its focus is to _complement_ them by extracting just the data that fits the needs of personal management.

### 2. Highly customizable

The project does support some level of customization, but it will never claim to be 'highly' customizable. Some features will be opinionated and strict to reduce vagueness and improve onboarding.
